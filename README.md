1. We first create a  Babylon.js playground by importing the CDN link in HTML file .
2. Then we create a canvas and use Engine to power the canvas .
3. We create a Scene and set the camera position , light and create a cube box of size 2 .
4. Then we attach a eventListener on positionDown and positionUp and extrude the Mesh on second click.
5. While extruding the cube along a direction we specify the type of animation along the edges and
extrude the cube along the dimension from from one point to another for a certain given length .
